# Bibliography

Physics bibliography.

Download: [`bibliography.bib`](https://github.com/goessl/bibliography/blob/main/bibliography.bib).

## Bibliography conventions

- `.bib` reference: [Overleaf/BibLaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_biblatex)
- Bibliography file as YAML: [`bibliography.yml`](https://github.com/goessl/bibliography/blob/main/bibliography.yml)
    - Every entry has a `type` and `id` item.
    - Remaining as for usual `bib` file.

### Necessary items

- Book
    - `author` or `editor`
    - `title`
    - `date`
    - `edition`
    - `publisher`
    - `isbn`
    - `doi`
    - `url`
- Booklet
    - `author`
    - `title`

### Values and formats

- `author`s as list
- e-book vs. hardcover
    Use e-book values. Often fields `date` and `isbn`.
- `date` in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

## Design

- **mkdocs-material**
    Setup from [goessl/templates](https://github.com/goessl/templates).
- **bibliography as YAML: [`bibliography.yml`](https://github.com/goessl/bibliography/blob/main/bibliography.yml)**
    - Single source of truth.
    - Common format that is easy to maintain and machine readable and convertible.
- **Hook: [`gen.py`](https://github.com/goessl/bibliography/blob/main/gen.py)**
    - Validates the YAML on every build.
    - Exports to JSON for Tabulator to read.
- **[Tabulator.js](https://www.tabulator.info/)**
    Needed for advanced formatting and filtering (especially because of authors column, which contains an array).
